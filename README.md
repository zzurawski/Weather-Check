# Weather-Check

## Description
This webpage allows the user to quickly grab current weather conditions and a five-day forecast. By just searching the city in the searchbar, the user will be able to see these results for their own pleasure. 

## How to Use
Open the index.html in the browser or the github pages to interact.

## Collaborators
I was able to utilize ideas we had in our event track project to help me figure out how to properly grab the api.

## Future Plans
I would like to sophisticate the styling of the page and figure out animations for the weather conditions.
